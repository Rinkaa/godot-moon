# Godot Moon

This is my personal customized Godot based on 4.3.0 stable.

## Changement

### Custom prefix of C# signal

In official builds, the custom C# signal is just general C# event, while the signals of godot's build-in nodes are all based on godot signal. I personally prefer the approach of godot signal, since it will automatically disconnect signals when relevant nodes exit the tree.

It's possible to use godot signal in C# by using `Connect`, but it's very inconvenient compared to `+=` approach. I altered the C# source generator to provide an easier way to use custom C# signal with godot signal approach.

In short, now the attribute `[Signal]` will generate three extra C# events:

```csharp
[Signal]
public delegate void TimeoutEventHandler();

public override void _Ready()
{
    // general C# event approach, we have to do `-=` manually
    Timeout += SomeFunc();

    // godot signal approach, equivalent to godot `Connect`
    SignalTimeout += SomeFunc();

    // godot signal with oneshot flag
    SignalOneshotTimeout += SomeFunc();

    // general C# event approach with simple oneshot support
    OneshotTimeout += SomeFunc();
}
```

### `TweenExtensions` for C#

Writing `Tween.TweenCallback(Callable.From(someFunc))` is annoyed, with `TweenExtensions` we can just write `Tween.TweenCallback(someFunc)` instead.

### `move_and_slide(delta)`

`move_and_slide` method of `CharacterBody2D/3D` now needs a `delta` parameter.

This provide an easy way to implement game speed control (e.g. gimmicks in Braid) by scaling the `delta` parameter.

## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of [common tools](https://godotengine.org/features), so that
users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can
be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop
platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as
Web-based platforms and [consoles](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/platform/consoles.html).

## Free, open source and community-driven

Godot is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://godotengine.org/license).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations. It is supported by the [Godot Foundation](https://godot.foundation/)
not-for-profit.

Before being open sourced in [February 2014](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac),
Godot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and
[Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining the project)
for several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire
titles.

## Getting the engine

### Binary downloads

Official binaries for the Godot editor and the export templates can be found
[on the Godot website](https://godotengine.org/download).

### Compiling from source

[See the official docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/compiling)
for compilation instructions for every supported platform.

## Community and contributing

Godot is not only an engine but an ever-growing community of users and engine
developers. The main community channels are listed [on the homepage](https://godotengine.org/community).

The best way to get in touch with the core engine developers is to join the
[Godot Contributors Chat](https://chat.godotengine.org).

To get started contributing to the project, see the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
This document also includes guidelines for reporting bugs.

## Documentation and demos

The official documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org).
It is maintained by the Godot community in its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs).

The [class reference](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/)
is also accessible from the Godot editor.

We also maintain official demos in their own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects)
as well as a list of [awesome Godot community resources](https://github.com/godotengine/awesome-godot).

There are also a number of other
[learning resources](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/tutorials.html)
provided by the community, such as text and video tutorials, demos, etc.
Consult the [community channels](https://godotengine.org/community)
for more information.
